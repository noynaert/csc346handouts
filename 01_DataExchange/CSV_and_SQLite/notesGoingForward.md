# Notes going forward

* Make a unit CSV and SQLite
* Finish up unit with csvToBean.  Make the ID field transient (for now)
* Make a database on country of origin.  Set up the database where the hashcode of the name is the key.
* Show how to add a field to the database
* Do a quick lecture on first normalized form
* The assignment this week is to "fix" the database and write a new "fixed" database in first normal form.

Do serialization/deserialization using JSON next week
