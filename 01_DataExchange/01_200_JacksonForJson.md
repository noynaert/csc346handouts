# 01.200 Jackson and Json

There are several ways to read and write JSON using Java.

- Native JSON class
- GSON
- Jackson

## Which package to use?

- The native JSON classes are relatively new.  They are not as well developed as Jackson or GSON.
- Jackson is built into most Java Frameworks.  Most frameworks allow you to change packages, but Jackson gets used a lot because it is the default
- There is a lot of developer confidence in Jackson
- Jackson also works with other formats including XML and YAML
