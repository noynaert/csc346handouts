# 01 XML 000 About CSC 346

This course started as a course dedicated to XML.  It was originally envisioned as being linked to C++.

XML was seen as the wonder-technology of the late 1990s and around 2000.

The Internet was coming into its own, and applications were needing to exchange data over the Internet.  XML was seen as the key.

Microsoft was still in a mindset of wanting to dominate the world of IT.  It created .NET technology.  It was originally an entire technology around .NET languages, XML, and SOAP.

Java grew up in competition with the .NET environment.  There was a video presented at JavaWorld.  Here is [the link to the video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb6ar-Fy5GQ).  The video is funny, but it is also NSFW and may be highly offensive to some people.  Watch at your own risk.

As part of the controversy about Java, there were some security problems with early Java.  Microsoft started putting out propaganda about the dangers of Java and started pushing storylines about Java getting shut down suddenly.  Javaworld had a response video.  The video is not as politically incorrect as the previous video.  It does contain a portrayal of Steven Hawking pole vaulting if you watch the background at the end of the video.
