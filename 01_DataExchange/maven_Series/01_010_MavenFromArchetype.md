# 01.010 Maven From Archetype

## What is Maven?

Maven is a build automation and project management tool primarily used for Java projects. It simplifies the build process by managing dependencies, compiling code, running tests, and packaging applications. Maven uses a declarative approach, where the project structure and configuration are defined in a `pom.xml` file (Project Object Model).

Maven also provides a standardized project layout and lifecycle, making it easier for developers to collaborate on projects.

## Creating a Maven Project from an Archetype

Maven archetypes are templates that provide a predefined structure for different types of projects. They help you quickly set up a new project with the necessary files and directories.

For simple Java projects, a good archetype to use is  the Apache Quickstart archetype.  The full name is `org.apache.maven.archetypes:maven-archetype-quickstart`
