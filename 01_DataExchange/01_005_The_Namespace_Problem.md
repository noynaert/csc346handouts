## Space

"Space" in Computer Science refers to the number of different options.

* Colorspace
* Addressspace
* Namespace

## Solution to the namespace problem

"Domain Name Backwards"

If you have the domain name noynaert.com, your packages should be named "com.noynaert"

```
com.noynaert.logger
edu.missouriwestern.noynaert
```
