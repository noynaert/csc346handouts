# 01.090 Maps

Disclaimer:  Maps are not themselves data exchange mechanisms.  But they are used with JSON (and sometimes XML).  

## Overview

Maps are not themselves a data exchange method.  But they are involved in a lot of data exchange.

In some languages Maps are called Associative Arrays.  They are arrays that are indexed by strings. 

## Key:Value pairs

Maps represent data in key:value pairs.  

Keys must be unique.  They are roughly similar to the primary key in a database because they must be unique.  But often they do have meaning in maps.  

In Java, Keys must be Objects.  Most commonly, they are Strings.  If you want to use numeric keys they must be "boxed" to one of the numeric "Wrapper" classes such as Double, Integer, or Long.

## The Abstract `Map` class

The Map class itself is Abstract.  This means we cannot directly create an object of Map class unless we extend it.  

We can declare variables to be of type Map, but they must be instantiated with one of their concrete child classes.  Here is an example:

```java
   Map people = new HashMap(30);
```

But starting with Java version 5 we can use ***generics*** to specify the data types of the key and the value.  In the following example, We will store values consisting of Person class using a String for the key.

```java
Map<String, Person> people = new HashMap<String, Person>(30);

// or, more simply:

Map<String, Person> people = new HashMap<>(30);
```

## Digression on Hashing and Hash tables in general

* Hash codes are ideally unique.  But there is no guarantee.
* Load Factor in a hash table

### Note the methods in Map<K,V>

### The major concrete subclasses

&nbsp;|**HashMap**|**HashTable**|**TreeMap**
:---:|:---|:---|:---
Ordered|No|No|Yes
Thread-safe|No, non-synchronized|Yes, Synchronized|No, non-synchronized
Ordered|No|No|Yes
Speed| Faster than a HashTable|Slower than a HashMap|Slower than either
Null keys|One null key allowed|No null key|No null key
Null values|Allowed|Not Allowed|Multiple keys may have null values
Requires<br>equals() and hashcode()|Yes|No|No (I think)
