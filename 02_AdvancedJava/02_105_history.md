## AWT -- The first package

AWT officially stood for "Abstract Windows Toolkit."  The common feeling was that it really stood for "Awful Windows Toolkit."

* AWT was not Object Oriented
* It did not cooperate with native OS Gui.  It did not follow the emerging standards.

## Swing -- The next attempt

Swing was better.  It at least Object Oriented and worked with the native OS

My impression of Swing was that it was created from a bunch of different parts developed by different people.  It also required you to use AWT for some components Swing had not yet incorporated.

Naming and metaphors were different in different parts of the program.

Swing was a tedious package to use.  It didn't help that different parts did not always work together very well.

## JavaFX -- The current standard

JavaFX feels like a more unified package.  It is also more complete.

A basic JavaFX program is fairly simple

The ability to create and edit an interface with XML is also a plus.
