Lecture Notes and related information for CSC 346, Enterprise Computing in Java

## Outline

(Preliminary)

Some material from Unit 02 (such as packages and Log4j may be covered as part of Unit 01 in order to get tools in place).

### Unit 00 -- Review

This material is intended to catch people up to the same level.  It will be presented before class starts.

This material will not be tested explicitly, but it will be background for everything in the course.  It establishes the skills I expect everyone has when starting the course.

There will be two simple assignments.  Technically the assignments will be due a week after class starts, but I am hoping most students will do them before the first day of classes.

* Up and running
  * Getting Java updated to a current LTS version
  * IDEs
  * Reading from a file.  Handling exceptions.
  * Reading from a URL. More on exceptions.  Exceptions as a model for Inheritance
  * Consulting Java APIs
* Objects
  * Creating Objects.  
  * Arrays of Objects
* Generic Basics
  
### Unit 01 Data Exchange

* Git
  * Setting up git security
    * 2FA (Two factor Authentication)
    * SSH -- For use at the command line
    * Tokens in IntelliJ (and maybe VS Code)
* Jar files
* Maven and Dependencies
  * Namespaces
    * Domain names
  * Dependencies
    * Log4j
* Reading from databases using JDBC
* Java Mappings, ArrayLists, Enumerated
* XML
* JSON
* Restful APIs

### Unit 02 -- Inheritance and Java Mechanics 

Some of this material will be covered quickly.  A lot of it should still be review.

* Javadocs
* Packages
* [Access Modifiers](https://beginnersbook.com/2013/05/java-access-modifiers/)
* Review of Inheritance
* Abstraction
  * Abstract methods
  * Abstract classes
  * Interfaces
* Helper Classes
  * Static methods and fields
* JavaFX as an example of inheritance running rampant in the streets (as time permits)

### Unit 03 Spring Framework

* Motivations
* Spring Boot
* Dependency Injection
* Websites and Restful APIs

This document is from the 2022 offering of the course.
