# 00.22.010 Intellij -- Getting started

Intellij is an IDE by JetBrains.  The "Idea" Ide may be the best Java IDE available.

## Versions

There is a Community edition of Intellij Idea.  It is OK for basic Java, but it lacks many features we will need in CSC 346.

The Ultimate edition is very powerful.  It costs approximately $500 per year per user.  There is a 30-day trial.  

If a student creates an account with JetBrains using their .edu address you can qualify for a free license to Ultimate as well as other JetBrains projects.  The use is limited to education and non-commercial use.

## Getting Started

Go to [https://jetbrains.com](https://jetbrains.com) and create a student account if you do not have one.  Then apply for a student license.  The license only lasts for a year.  If you license has expired you may renew it.

Download the Intellij IDEA Ultimate and download it.  Then go through the regular install procedure.  You will be prompted to register it with your Jetbrains account.  You may also put in a license number from your "My Account" page.
