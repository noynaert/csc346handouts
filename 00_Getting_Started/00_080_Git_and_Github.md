# 00.080 Git and Github

Git and Github are essential tools for modern software development.  They allow you to manage your code, collaborate with others, and keep track of changes over time.

## Git
Git is a version control system.  It allows you to keep track of changes to your code over time.  It also allows you to collaborate with others on the same code base.

Git runs on your local computer.  You can use Git from the command line or from a graphical user interface (GUI). Most modern IDEs have built-in support for Git.

## Github
GitHub is a web-based platform that uses Git for version control.  It allows you to host your code repositories online, collaborate with others, and manage projects.  There are other similar platforms, such as GitLab and Bitbucket.

## Practical approach

Git and Github can be confusing.  Git was developed as a command line tool for maintaining the Linux kernel.  Kernel programmers are not normal human beings, so the user interface is not very user friendly.  Github was developed later as a web-based platform for hosting Git repositories.

[Mandatory XKCD](https://xkcd.com/1597/)

The best way to learn Git and Github is to use them.  Here are some basic steps to get started:

## Setting up for this course

1. Create a Github account at https://github.com if you do not already have one. Use your @missouriwestern.edu email address.
2. Go to https://education.github.com/pack and scroll down to "Verify your student status".  Click on the link and follow the instructions to get access to the GitHub Student Developer Pack.
3. I suggest that you create an SSH key for your Github account.  This will allow you to securely connect to Github from your local computer without having to enter your username and password every time.  Follow the instructions at one of the following guides.   The procedures will be a little different deending on your operating system

   * [https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account)
5. Go to https://classroom.github.com/ and sign in with your Github account.
6. Create a new repository.  ***Make sure it is private.***  The repository will be used for homework assignments and projects.
  * Create a README.md file
  * Create a .gitignore file.  Select Java from the list of templates.
  * This is a private project, so do not add a license.
7. Clone the repository to your local computer.  

## Edit the README.md file

You can use any text editor (not a word processor) to edit the README.md file.  You can also use an IDE such as VS Code or IntelliJ IDEA.  However, I suggest using something like VS Code that has built-in support for Git.  

When using VS Code, try to open folders, not individual files.  This will allow VS Code to recognize the Git repository.  Both VS Code and git "think" in terms of directories (folders).

The README.md file is a markdown file.  Markdown is a simple markup language that allows you to format text.  You can use markdown to create headings, lists, links, and other formatting.

* Use # to create the title.  On the first line of the file you should see a # followed by a space and then the title of the project.
* Use ## to create sub-headings.  Be sure to put a space after the ##, and make sure the ## are the first characters on the line.
Double space at the end of a line to create a line break. ***Do not indent the first line of paragraphs.***

## .gitignore file

The .gitignore file tells Git which files and directories to ignore.  This is useful for ignoring files that are generated by the IDE or build system, such as .class files or .idea directories.

It starts with a period.   In Linux and Unix systems (including MacOS), files that start with a period are hidden files.  You can use the command `ls -a` to see hidden files in a directory.

I suggest adding the following lines to the .gitignore file:

```
# Ignore temporary files
*.tmp
*.log
*.bak
tmp/*

## Now let's update the repository

```
  git stash
  git add .
  git commit -m 'Initial commit'
  git push

  Now, go look at your github repository in your web browser.  You should see the README.md file and the .gitignore file with your updates.

## Add me as a collaborator

- Go to Settings → Collaborators (may need to click "Manage access" first)
     - Click "Add people" 
     - Enter 'noynaert' and click "Add noynaert to this repository"
     - Select Read permission
