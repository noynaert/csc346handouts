# 00.110 Git and Github

Git and Github are essential tools for modern software development. They allow you to manage your code, collaborate with others, and keep track of changes over time.

## Git

Git is a version control system. It allows you to keep track of changes to your code over time. It also allows you to collaborate with others on the same code base.

Git runs on your local computer. You can use Git from the command line or from a graphical user interface (GUI). Most modern IDEs have built-in support for Git.

## Github

GitHub is a web-based platform that uses Git for version control. It allows you to host your code repositories online, collaborate with others, and manage projects. There are other similar platforms, such as GitLab and Bitbucket.

## Practical approach

Git and Github can be confusing. Git was developed as a command line tool for maintaining the Linux kernel. Kernel programmers are not normal human beings, so the user interface is not very user friendly. Github was developed later as a web-based platform for hosting Git repositories.

The best way to learn Git and Github is to use them. Here are some basic steps to get started:

## Setting up for this course

Pick a name for your repository. In this case it is going to hold your homework. I will be cloning it to my computer so that I can see your work. To help me, please start your repo with your last name followed by something referencing homework. For example, if your name is Smith, you might use something like "smithHomework346 or smithCSC346Homework. (We will talk about the "Namespace Problem" later in the course. This will be our first example.)

1. Create a Github account at https://github.com if you do not already have one. Use your @missouriwestern.edu email address.
2. Go to https://education.github.com/pack and scroll down to "Verify your student status". Click on the link and follow the instructions to get access to the GitHub Student Developer Pack.
3. I suggest that you create an SSH key for your Github account. This will allow you to securely connect to Github from your local computer without having to enter your username and password every time. Follow the instructions at one of the following guides. The procedures will be a little different depending on your operating system

   - [https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account)
4. Go to https://classroom.github.com/ and sign in with your Github account.
5. Create a new repository. **_Make sure it is private._** The repository will be used for homework assignments and projects.

- Create a README.md file
- Create a .gitignore file. Select Java from the list of templates.
- This is a private project, so do not add a license.

## Add me as a collaborator

- Go to Settings → Collaborators (may need to click "Manage access" first)
  - Click "Add people"
  - Enter 'noynaert' and click "Add noynaert to this repository"
  - Select Read permission
