* Objective is to get everyone to a common starting point

## Which Java?

We need a Java Development Kit (JDK).  Note that this is different than the Java Runtime Environment (JRE).

You will probably need to update your version.  You may figure out what you have with the following commands:

```bash
   java   --version
   javac  --version
```

### Which Distribution?

* Oracle JDK 
* OpenJDK
* RedHat JDK

### Which Version?

Use of "Long Term Support" or LTS versions are recommended for Java development.

It is possible to have more than one version of Java on your system.  This is by design.  But it is important to make sure you IDE is using the version you intend to use.

### Minimum version for CSC 346

* Use of a LTS version is recommended
* We will be using features not added until Version 11
* Version 21 LTS is recommended.  Version 17 LTS is the minimum.

#### Updating Java 

You should be able to install a new version of the JDK and leave the old system in place.  

Be sure to use the following commands to make sure your system is using the most recent version of Java.

```bash
   java   --version
   javac  --version
```

# Set environmental variables.  I had to add these manually to my ~/.profile
export JAVA_HOME=/opt/jdk-21
export PATH=$PATH:$JAVA_HOME/bin 
sudo update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/java "java" $JAVA_HOME/bin/java 1
sudo update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/javac "javac" $JAVA_HOME/bin/javac 1
sudo update-alternatives --config java  # Then pick the jdk-21 option
sudo update-alternatives --config javac # Then pick the jdk-21 option

# test versions
```bash
echo $JAVA_HOME
javac --version
java --version
```

You may want to logoff and back on to make sure your preferred version survives.
