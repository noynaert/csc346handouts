# 03.130 Json Output from Spring

Doing output to JSON is almost effortless.

- Jackson is included in the base package of Spring
  - It may be changed
  - Jackson is effectively invisible
- Objects are automatically rendered as JSON unless you take steps to make them something else
  - No need to serialize the object
  - Jackson uses getters to generate the JSON.
  - No default or noarg() constructor is required
