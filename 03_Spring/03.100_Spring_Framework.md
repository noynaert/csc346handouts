# 3.100 Spring Framework Overview

Spring is the most important Programming Framework in Java

## Programming Frameworks

- Frameworks are available in most programming languages.
- Frameworks provide a skeleton (or framework) for programs.  
  - Programmer focuses on the business model instead of the overall program structure
  - Frameworks usually have a lot of optional components that can be added easily
  - Frameworks are robust
  - Frameworks make it relatively easy to swap major components, such as database software.
- The programmer @tags methods and data values that play certain roles in the program.  The @tags are usually a message to the framework.
- Most Frameworks are web and internet oriented
  - APIs provide json, xml, yaml, csv, or other common formats
  - Most frameworks also can serve web pages and forms.  Some frameworks are mainly oriented that way.
  - Frameworks have a steep learning curve.  (In other words, they take some time to learn)
    - It helps if you know another framework.
    - Once you learn the framework it *can be* very quick to spin up a complete system or a major system component.
      - Spring is NOT easy or quick to set up
      - Spring Boot makes it easy to set up Spring projects
  
  ## Common Concepts

  ### Inversion of Control (IoC) and Dependency Injection

  These are important concepts.  Don't let them be a barrier to using frameworks.

  [Link to article if you want to dig in](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/inversion-control-ioc-design-principle-jahid-momin/)

  When you need a resource, the framework provides it.  The interface is generally an abstract, universal interface with the resource.

  #### Opposite of IoC

  We have been doing the opposite of Inversion of Control for JSON, SQL, and CSV files.  Think about the first program we did where we downloaded and manually added the JAR file for CSV programs.  We focused on providing the resource.  Not only did we add the jar file manually, we also had to program in the links and other parameters.

  We started abstracting those away when we began using MAVEN.  But we were still concerned with setting up the parameters for those functions.

## Dependency Injection

Dependency Injection means passing components as arguments rather than declaring them inside the function.

## Major components

Spring has some builtin components, but it also has sub-frameworks that may be added depending on the specific application.

* Spring Batch (batch processing)
* Spring Integration (integration between systems)
* Spring Data (database)
* Spring Security (adds authentication and other serves)
* Spring Cloud (integration with cloud services)


## Strongly recommended video

I recommend [this 2025 video about Spring Boot](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v73-ps01c5w).  It is only about 4 minutes.
