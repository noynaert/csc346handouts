# 03.140 application.properties and Debugging

## The `application.properties` file

There are several ways to control various aspects of the program.  

One option is a file called `src/main/resources/application.properties`

Most of the things in application.properties may be set in the pom.xml file or in a yaml file.  Many of them may also be set in the Java source code itself.

### The basic `application.properties` file

```text
spring.application.name=SpringJsonOutput
```

### Fixing the Tomcat restart problem

```text
spring.application.name=SpringJsonOutput
spring.devtools.restart.enabled=false
```

## Log4j Logging Levels

By default, Spring Boot uses the Log4j package for logging.  It logs
to the console, but it may also log to a file or URL

Log4j has the following logging levels.  "Trace" is the most verbose.  "FATAL" has the lowest logging levels.  There are colors associated with each level, but it is common to see the same color applied to TRACE/DEBUG, INFO/WARN, and ERROR/FATAL.

Logging Level|Color
:---:|:---:
TRACE|Gray
DEBUG|Blue
INFO|Green
WARN|Yellow
ERROR|Red
FATAL|Black

Spring defaults to INFO for the entire project.

DEBUG and TRACE are often used.

In the application.properties file (or yaml, or elsewhere) may be used to set levels for specific packages or classes.

```text
spring.application.name=SpringJsonOutput
spring.devtools.restart.enabled=false
logging.level.root=INFO
logging.level.edu.missouriwestern.noynaert.springjsonoutput.Controllers=INFO
```
