# 03.120 MVC

MVC means "Model View Controller"

## Model

The model is the data and "business logic."

The model is usually the database plus methods that do operations relevant to the application.

## View

Views are very limited.  They can be something like the text of a web page with places to inject specific variables.

```html
   <h2>Hello, {name}</h2>
   <img src="{fileName}" alt="{text}"/>
   <ul>
        <li>{list, @foreach(item:list)}</li>
   </ul>
```

## Controller

Very roughly, the controller involves instructions for moving data between the view and model.

In Java FX, we mostly were writing the controller.  "When button is pressed, put the name in the label area."

### Routing

Part of the controller's job is "Routing."

A ***route*** is the part of the URL after the slash.

In the demo program, we have 3 routes defined

- /
- /today
- /catfact

Routes can be more complex.  They can have variables encoded into their route.

- /catfact/3

The above would be use in place of something like the following

- catfact?n=3

#### The controller we made

```java
@RestController
public class SimpleController {
    @RequestMapping(path="/")
    public String root() {
        return """
                <h1>Greetings, Earthling</h1>
                
                <p>Have a nice day.</p>
                
                <p><em><strong>Order pizza.</strong><em></p>
                """;
    }

    @RequestMapping(path = "/today")
    public String today(){
        LocalDate now = LocalDate.now();
        String message = String.format( "<h1>Today is %s</h1>",now.getDayOfWeek());
        return message;
    }

    @RequestMapping(path="/catfact")
    public String catFact() {
        return """
                {
                fact: "When a cat chases its prey, it keeps its head level. Dogs and humans bob their heads up and down.",
                length: 97
                }
                """;
    }
}
```
