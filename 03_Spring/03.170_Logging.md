# 03.170 Logging in Spring

Log4J used to be the major logging package used in Java.  

Log4J2 came out in 2014.  It had a lot of new features, but Log4J dominated.  

In December, 2021 a major security vulnerability was discovered in Log4J.  The problem was that mos major Java programs were using it.

The security problems with Log4J opened the door for other logging software.  Apache Common Logging is now the default logging software in Spring Boot, although Log4J and Log4J2 are also available.

Apache maintains Log4J, Log4J2 and Common Logging.

In practice, they all operate in similar ways.

## `application.properties`

The `application.properties` needs to be modified.

The following lines in `application.properties` would do the following:

- Sets the overall project to WARN level.  This is assuming that the framework are assumed to be correct.  INFO would also be a common level.
- Sets everything in the package I wrote to DEBUG
- Sets my JsonController class to Trace.  Presumably, I am concerned about how the JsonController is misbehaving.

```text
logging.level.root=WARN
logging.level.edu.missouriwestern.noynaert:DEBUG
logging.level.edu.missouriwestern.noynaert.finalexam60.Controller.JsonController:TRACE
```


## Each class must include a declaration

```java
    private static final Log log = LogFactory.getLog(JsonController.class);
```

The name of the class would replace `JsonController.`

## The methods to be tested would include calls to the level functions as needed.

```java
@GetMapping(path="/")
    public String getRoot() {
        log.info("The / root was called");
        log.debug("The / root was called");
        log.trace("The / root was called");
        String s = """
                <ul>
                <li> / is this page
                <li> /stockInfo shows some facts about stocks
                <li> /stock/{number} shows your selected number
                </ul>
                """;
        return s;
    }

    @GetMapping(path="/date")
    public String getDate(){
        log.info("Entering getDate()");
        LocalDate now = LocalDate.now();
        log.trace(String.format("The raw date is %s",now.toString()));
        String today = String.valueOf(now.getDayOfWeek());
        log.debug("Day of Week: " + today);
        return today;
    }
```
