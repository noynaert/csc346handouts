# 03.000.Markdown

The homework 11 assignment is to be written in Markdown notation.  Specifically, we will be using the Github dialect of Markdown.

## VS Code

There are quite a few Markdown editors.  VS Code, like Github, is owned by Microsoft.  I think Code is one of the best Markdown editors available.

Be sure to invoke "preview."

## Paragraphs

Paragraphs are separated by blank lines. ***Do not indent paragraphs.***  In Reddit markdown, indenting paragraphs throws you into "code" mode which is hard to read.  In Github markdown, it throws the text into "block quote" mode.

## Code

In github markdown, backticks are used to mark code.  The backtick character is &grave;.  It is known as "accent grave" in French.  On most English keyboards it is to the left of the 1 key under the tilde ~ mark.

Inline, words or strings maybe surrounded by &grave; symbols.  For example, perhaps I want to talk about `String[] args` in a Java program.  Typing &grave;String[] args&grave; highlights the code.

### Longer blocks of code

The Markdown "code" format would correspond to the &lt;pre&gt; tag in HTML.  It may be used for computer code or for things like poems.

```
           Science Limerick

There once was a lady named Bright
   whose speed was much faster than light.
She set off one day,
   in a relative way,
   and returned the previous night.
```

Three backticks at the start of the line begin the preformatted or code text.  Another three backticks end it.

Optionally, you may type the language right after the beginning backticks.  This will usually give syntax highlighting in the specified language.  View the raw source code of this page to see how it is done.

```java
public static void main(String[] args){
    System.out.println("Hello, World!");
}
```

## Headings

Headings are done with hash tags (#).  They correspond to &lt;h1&gt; through &lt;h6&gt;.  In Markdown they run from # through ######.

Be sure to put a blank space after the last # and the first letter of the title.

## Bullet points

* Bullet points may use either a * or a - at the left margin.
* Be sure to put a blank space after the * or -.
  * If you indent the bullet 2 spaces off the left margi, it gives nested bullets.
    * Two more indents gives more nesting.

1. Numbered lists are also possible.
1. The numbering is automatic; you can list every item as a 1. and it will automatically number things correctly.
1. I recommend always using 1. because if you try to manually number, the editing gets tricky.

## Blank lines around line-based formatting

There should be a blank line above and below every header, code block, or table.

Don't include extra blank lines.

## Links

Links are indicated by putting the visible text in square brackets, then following immediately by putting the link in parenthesis.

```
[The visible link](http://example.com)
```

## Images

Displaying images is similar to links.  HTML recommends including alternative text if the image is not visible.  In the US, ADA can be interpreted to mean that alternative text is required for non-decorative links.  In markdown, the notation is similar to links, except there is a ! placed before the first square bracket.  I interpret the ! to mean "not" because the "visible text" becomes invisible in most cases.
