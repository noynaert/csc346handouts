# 03.110 MVC

MVC means "Model View Controller"

## Model

The model is the data and "business logic."

The model is usually the database plus methods that do operations relevant to the application.

## View

Views are very limited.  They can be something like the text of a web page with places to inject specific variables.

```html
   <h2>Hello, {name}</h2>
   <img src="{fileName}" alt="{text}"/>
   <ul>
        <li>{list, @foreach(item:list)}</li>
   </ul>
```

## Controller

Very roughly, the controller involves instructions for moving data between the view and model.

In Java FX, we mostly were writing the controller.  "When button is pressed, put the name in the label area."
